# mini-projects
Very simple mini-projects written entirely in C++

### Temperature Converter (Coming Soon)
<del><a href=''>This</a> is a very simple temperature converter written in C++, in which the user can specify if they want to convert to celsius from fahrenheit or vice versa. The user can then enter the value they want to convert and the program converts that value and returns the converted value.</del>

### Fibonacci Sequence Number Generator (Coming Soon)
<del><a href=''>This</a> is a very simple Fibonacci sequnece number generator, which takes an nth number specified by the user and finds the value at that nth number of the Fibonacci sequence.</del>

### Quadrilateral Maker/Drawer
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/cpp-mini-projects/blob/main/quadrilateral.cpp'>This</a> is a very simple program, which takes values from the user (width and height) and creates a square. The user also specifies what symbol they want to use also.

### Triangle Maker/Drawer
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/cpp-mini-projects/blob/main/triangle.cpp'>This</a> is a simple triangle maker/drawer, which takes a value from the user (this will be both width and height) and creates a right-angled triangle. The user also specifies what symbol they want to use also.

### Number Guessing Game
<a href='https://github.com/sudo-harun/cpp-mini-projects/blob/main/number-guessing-game.cpp'>This</a> is a number guessing game. The program generates a number between 1 and 100, and then asks the user to submit a guess. Upon a wrong guess, the user is then informed whether their guess was too low or too high, and how far they are from the actual number. Once the correct guess has been submitted, the program print "You win!" then quits.
